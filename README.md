# search_algorithm_BFS_DFS-Page_Rank

## Goal:
Implement BFS and DFS search algorithm.
Designing and implementing recursive functions.
Understanding and implementing the page rank algorithm.

## Files:
comp614_module6.py: This contains several class definitions: Stack, Queue, and DiGraph. It also contains my implementation of the file_to_graph method, which you will need to use for testing and analysis.

hw6.py: This is the code for the functions that I implemented for BFS, DFS, and Page Rank algorithm.

wikipedia_articles_streamlined.txt: This is a text file that includes a real data set that was mined from Wikipedia. It is a streamlined version of the file that you were given in homework 4, with only 785 nodes. This streamlining was performed in order to allow you to run the PageRank algorithm efficiently on this graph.

DFS_text: text files that include small artificial data sets that you can use for testing, in the same format as wikipedia_articles_streamlined.txt
