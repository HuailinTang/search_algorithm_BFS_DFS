# search_algorithm_BFS-Page_Rank

comp614_module6.py: This contains several class definitions: Stack, Queue, and DiGraph. It also contains my implementation of the file_to_graph method from homework 4, which you will need to use for testing and analysis.

hw6.py: This is the template code for the functions that you will implement in this assignment. Included in this file is my implementation of the BFS algorithm from homework 4 (which is now called "bfs_dfs").

wikipedia_articles_streamlined.txt: This is a text file that includes a real data set that was mined from Wikipedia, in the same format that you encountered in homework 4. It is a streamlined version of the file that you were given in homework 4, with only 785 nodes. This streamlining was performed in order to allow you to run the PageRank algorithm efficiently on this graph.

test0.txt - test9.txt: These are text files that include small artificial data sets that you can use for testing, in the same format that you encountered in homework 4.
